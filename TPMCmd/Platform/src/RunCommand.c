//**Introduction
// This module provides the platform specific entry and fail processing. The
// _plat__RunCommand() function is used to call to ExecuteCommand() in the TPM code.
// This function does whatever processing is necessary to set up the platform
// in anticipation of the call to the TPM including settup for error processing.
//
// The _plat__Fail() function is called when there is a failure in the TPM. The TPM
// code will have set the flag to indicate that the TPM is in failure mode.
// This call will then recursively call ExecuteCommand in order to build the
// failure mode response. When ExecuteCommand() returns to _plat__Fail(), the
// platform will do some platform specific operation to return to the environment in
// which the TPM is executing. For a simulator, setjmp/longjmp is used. For an OS,
// a system exit to the OS would be appropriate.

//** Functions

//***_plat__RunCommand()
// This version of RunCommand will set up a jum_buf and call ExecuteCommand(). If
// the command executes without failing, it will return and RunCommand will return.
// If there is a failure in the command, then _plat__Fail() is called and it will
// longjump back to RunCommand which will call ExecuteCommand again. However, this
// time, the TPM will be in failure mode so ExecuteCommand will simply build
// a failure response and return.

    uint32_t        requestSize,   // IN: command buffer size
    unsigned char*  request,       // IN: command buffer

    unsigned char** response       // IN/OUT: response buffer
)
{
    setjmp(s_jumpBuffer);
    ExecuteCommand(requestSize, request, responseSize, response);
}

//***_plat__Fail()
// This is the platform depended failure exit for the TPM.
LIB_EXPORT NORETURN void _plat__Fail(void)
