## Supported Crypto Libraries

A compatible crypto library is required in order to build the TPM simulator.

| Crypto library | Supported Minimum Version |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| OpenSSL 1.x    | `1.1.1n` (March 2022)     |
| OpenSSL 3.x    | `3.0.10` (August 2023)    |
| WolfSSL        | Not supported             |

Bindings for WolfSSL are provided on a best-effort basis, but WolfSSL is not
currently tested or supported by any of the build documentation.

## Build Options

The TPM Reference Core Library is intended to be portable across any
environment.  The Simulator Test application requires a full operating system
with networking support.

This repo currently supports three build options with various levels of support.
Unsupported combinations may work, but are not tested or maintained.  Pull
requests to fix any issues with them will be entertained from the community
subject to the [Contributing Guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

| Build Tool         | Operating System | Supported?               |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| AutoTools          | Linux            | YES, Deprecation planned |
| AutoTools          | MacOsX           | NO                       |
| CMake              | Windows          | YES                      |
| CMake              | Linux            | NO, Future plan          |
| Visual Studio 2017 | Windows          | YES, Deprecation planned |
| Visual Studio 2022 | Windows          | NO, Future plan          |

## Future Work

As implied by the table above, CMake is expected to replace AutoTools support,
and VS2022 will replace VS2017.
